		<h2>2) Chariot Path of King Rawana,Pussallawa Udapalatha,Kandy,Sri Lanka</h2>
		
			<dl class="des2">
				<dt><b>Location</b></dt>
				<dd><a class="location1" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/QKEuGMucVfG8EJZz9">Click here to view on Map</a>
				<dt><b>Introduction:</b></dt>
					<dd>The chariot path is the route which Ravana transported Sita Devi on his chariot from Sita Kotuwa 
					to Ashoka Vatika also known as Ravana grass pathway which is located jungle on the top of Ramboda Hills on the Kandy – Nuwara Eliya 
					main road. This is one of the iconic Ramayana sites in Sri Lanka.
					The Sita tear pond is a small pond that can be found en-route by the chariot path. A pond located on this Chariot Path is believed to have been
					formed here by the tears of Sita Devi and has not dried up so far even during severe droughts when the adjoining rivers do. 
					It is located on top of a mountain range in the central highlands of Sri Lanka which has spectacular views from an angle of 360 degrees around.</dd>

				<dt><b>Route:</b></dt>
					<dd>Starting your journey from Colombo, you will first need to reach Gampola. From Gampola, take a bus to Pussallawa village, where you should hire a car 
					capable of handling rough roads to get to Frotoft estate/Perettasi village, a trip that takes about 1.5 to 2 hours. Buses are an alternative, but they are infrequent. 
					Upon arrival, locate the old hospital facility where the trailhead begins. The hike through the tea estate is relatively easy, but the climb along the footpath is more 
					challenging and takes 2 to 3 hours. Along the way, you'll enjoy scenic views of Kotmale Reservoir, Pidurangala, Hanguranketha, Sri Padaya, and Hewaheta, making it worthwhile
					to spend at least half a day exploring this Ramayana site. Be prepared for chilly weather and wind, especially at night, and wear long-sleeved clothing to protect yourself from the 
					spiky grass. Note that this journey is not suitable for senior citizens or those with heart or respiratory issues.</dd>


				<dt><b>Weather:</b> </dt>
				<dd>Most of the year, the Chariot Path receives rainfall. The temperature ranges from 10°C to 24°C. Between October and January, heavy monsoon rains fall. The months of February through April
				are ideal for visiting the Chariot Path. Between these months, the majority of the days are bright, with the least amount of rain.</dd>

			<h2> 3) Kabaragala,Nawalapitiya, Sri Lanka </h2>
			<dl class="des1">
				<dt><b>Location</b></dt>
				<dd><a class="location1" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/yzcW8xVEcmBdpH666">Click here to view on Map</a>
				<dt><b>Introduction:</b></dt>
					<dd>Kabaragala is the highest mountain peak within the Dolosbage range, soaring approximately 1506 meters above sea level</dd>

				<dt><b>Route:</b></dt>
					<dd>Your exploration of Kabaragala kicks off at the Maryville Junction. As you embark on this journey,
					you traverse through a variety of terrains, each contributing to the charm of the adventure. The expedition 
					starts with a stop at a Kovil, then proceeds along a concrete road leading to the mountain. As you step into a tea estate,
					the path becomes narrower, funneling you onto a slim but clearly marked trail.
					As you advance, a quaint forest filled with pine trees welcomes you. After about an hour of hiking, you arrive at the 
					first viewpoint – a spot that offers breathtaking views of the landscape around you. This is a moment that truly rewards the effort of the trek.
					While the first viewpoint marks a common stopping point for many hikers, the true beauty of Kabaragala awaits those who venture further. The terrain closely mirrors Horton Plains, 
					showcasing mana trees and savanna-type plants. The remarkable drop towards the bottom, reminiscent of the world's end, adds an element of thrill and wonder.

					After an invigorating two-hour hike, you'll stand triumphant at the summit of Kabaragala Mountain. The view from this vantage point is nothing short of breathtaking. The panorama
					encompasses the Kothmale Reservoir, Peacock Hills, Kothmale Area, Dolosbage Area, Pusellawa, Ambuluwawa, and the iconic Sri Pada Mountain. Additionally, you'll be able to gaze upon 
					lesser-known mountains and quaint villages. Photographers will find themselves in paradise, especially during the early morning when mist blankets the landscape. Keep an eye out for
					the captivating sight of clouds nestled beneath the mountains, a signature feature of Kabaragala.</dd>
					<dt><b>Transportation:</b></dt>
					<dd>Reaching Kabaragala is an adventure with two primary routes for exploration. One starts from Nawalapitiya, while the other originates from the Gampola side. The distances 
					to Kabaragala vary: 11 km from Colombo, 40 km from Kandy, 24 km from Gampola, and 20 km from Nawalapitiya. If you're coming from Colombo, the route passes through Avissawella and Ginigathhena 
					to Nawalapitiya. For those starting from Kandy, Gampola is your gateway.

					Public transport is readily available at the hike's starting point. By taking the Dolosbage bus from either bus stop, you can expect an hour's journey to reach the hiking trail's entrance.</dd>
